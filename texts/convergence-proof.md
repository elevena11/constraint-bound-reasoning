# Constraint-derived convergence analysis

## Justificatory termination and ontological independence

---

# 1) Problem statement

Let **S** denote a system consisting of internal states, rules, parameters, representations, and governing laws.

Define:

* **Justification**: a relation that licenses some element (rule, claim, parameter, or representation) as valid without collapsing into mere assertion.
* **Circularity risk**: a justificatory chain that returns to what it attempts to justify.
* **Regress risk**: a justificatory chain that never terminates.

Define **termination**:

* **Termination**: a point beyond which no further justificatory dependence exists.

Previously we introduced:

* **The Anchor (A)**: the necessary termination point for justification that prevents both circularity and infinite regress.

Question:

> Must justificatory termination (the Anchor) necessarily coincide with what exists independently of the system?

That is:

> Does epistemic termination necessarily converge with ontological independence?

The derivation must proceed only by constraint enforcement and elimination of alternatives.

# 2) Constraints

Only the following constraints are used.

## C1 — Representation–Reality Distinction

Representations are distinct from reality.
Internal states do not constitute what they represent.

## C5 — Objective Reality Independence

Reality exists independently of observers and representations and provides the only external basis for verification.

## C6 — Meaning Boundary Constraint

Validity cannot arise from arbitrary assignment or redefinition.
Roles and classes must be explicitly bounded to prevent equivocation.

## C7 — Self-verifying Consistency

Systems must prevent circular self-certification and infinite justificatory regress.

---

# 3) Necessity of termination (C7)

Suppose justification does not terminate.

Two possibilities:

### Circularity

A chain returns to its starting element.
Validity is then licensed by procedures that already presuppose that validity.

This is self-certification and violates C7.

### Infinite regress

Each element depends on a further element with no base case.
No element becomes justified.

Justification never completes.

This also violates C7.

Therefore:

**Justification must terminate.**

There must exist some termination point A.

---

# 4) Elimination of internal candidates (C1, C6, C7)

We test whether any element wholly contained within S can serve as A.

---

## 4.1 Internal coherence or consistency

Claim: rules are valid because they are internally consistent.

But:

* consistency is evaluated using S’s own inferential procedures,
* those procedures presuppose the rules being validated.

Thus validation is circular.

Rejected by C7.

---

## 4.2 Definitions or stipulation

Claim: axioms are valid by definition.

But:

* this collapses warrant into assignment,
* validity becomes arbitrary naming.

Under C6, meaning cannot generate validity without constraint.

Rejected.

---

## 4.3 Consensus or authority internal to S

Claim: validity arises from agreement or internal authorization.

But:

* agreement and authority are internal states,
* their force depends on S’s own criteria.

Thus they remain representational and circular.

Rejected by C7.

---

## Result of Section 4

No element wholly contained in S can terminate justification non-circularly.

Therefore A cannot be internal.

---

# 5) Required properties of a valid termination point

From the eliminations and constraints, any valid terminator must satisfy:

1. **Externality**
   Not defined, constituted, or validated by S’s representations, rules, or internal states.

2. **Asymmetry**
   S depends on A, but A does not depend on S for its validity.

3. **Non-representational authority** (C1)
   A’s validity cannot be produced by representation.

4. **Boundary preservation** (C6, C7)
   A must terminate justification without circularity or drift.

Any candidate lacking these properties fails to terminate justification.

---

# 6) Bridge step — comparison with ontological independence (C5)

Now evaluate whether these required properties match ontological independence as specified by C5.

C5 states:

* reality exists independently of representations and observers,
* and provides the only external basis for verification.

Compare:

| Required for A          | Provided by C5                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| external to S           | independent of observers/representations |
| asymmetric              | not dependent on system states           |
| non-representational    | not constituted by representation        |
| capable of verification | constrains what can be valid             |

The properties coincide.

---

## Test alternative: external but not independent

Assume A is external but not ontologically independent.

Then either:

### Case 1 — A depends (directly or indirectly) on representational systems

Dependency reintroduces circularity at a higher level.
C7 violated.

### Case 2 — A provides no independent constraint

Then no verification occurs.
C5 violated.

Thus:

No merely “external” but dependent entity can satisfy the required properties.

The only admissible class remaining is ontologically independent reality.

---

# 7) Conclusion

**Result (under constraints {C1, C5, C6, C7}): True.**

Given these constraints:

* justification must terminate,
* internal elements cannot terminate non-circularly,
* a terminator must be external and asymmetric,
* and C5 defines the only admissible form of such independence.

Therefore:

> Justificatory termination necessarily converges with ontological independence.

If C5 is removed, this convergence is no longer forced and the result becomes undefined.
With C5 enforced, convergence is necessary.

---

This completes the constraint-internal necessity derivation.
