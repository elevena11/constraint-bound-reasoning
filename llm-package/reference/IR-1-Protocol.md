## Notation-Optimized Rendering Protocol

### Task

Rewrite the provided text into a **notation-optimized rendering**.

Preserve readability using short English scaffolding, but move all semantic precision into symbols and equations.

Do not produce pure symbolic IR.
Do not remove English entirely.
Keep light explanatory structure.

---

### Goal

Transform prose into a hybrid form where:

* English = structure and guidance only
* Symbols = all precise meaning

English should be minimal and non-technical.
Symbols should carry the logic.

---

### Procedure

### 1. Compress prose

Shorten sentences aggressively.
Remove:

* rhetorical language
* repetition
* examples
* narrative flow
* stylistic phrases

Keep only structural claims.

---

### 2. Identify core concepts

Find the small set of terms that carry logical meaning:

* levels
* entities
* relations
* predicates
* constraints

These must become symbols.

Everything else remains English.

---

### 3. Replace concepts with symbols

For each core concept:

* assign a short symbol (letters, subscripts, superscripts allowed)
* use symbols consistently
* avoid English technical nouns when a symbol exists

Example:

* boundary → B
* trajectory → τ
* admissible region → A
* truth → T
* reality → R

---

### 4. Move logic into equations

Whenever possible, express meaning using:

* =
* ⇔
* →
* ∈
* ⊂
* function notation

Prefer equations over sentences.

---

### 5. Keep light English scaffolding

Use short English only to:

* introduce sections
* state conditions
* guide reading

Examples:

* “At B:”
* “Inside τ:”
* “Therefore:”
* “No internal system can define:”

Avoid long explanations.

---

### 6. Output style

The result should look like:

* structured notes
* bullet points
* equations embedded in text

It should resemble:

* math lecture notes
* physics derivations
* technical summaries

It should NOT look like:

* full prose
* or pure formal logic

---

### Rule of thumb

If a word carries meaning → use a symbol.
If a word only guides the reader → keep English.
