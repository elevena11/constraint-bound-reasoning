Note on scope:
This document provides a human-readable overview of how semantic fractures may be identified and handled in practice. It is not a required procedure. The framework constrains that fractures must be detectable; how they are handled is intentionally left to the local reasoning process.

# Local Fracture Handling — Layer Separation Protocol

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines a **local, context-bound method** for handling semantically fractured terms that appear during derivations.

Its goal is to prevent silent semantic re-coherence **after** a fracture has been discovered, while avoiding any global redefinition of language.

---

## Definition: Semantic Fracture

A semantic fracture occurs when a single term simultaneously invokes:
- a **structural layer** (admissible under constraint), and
- a **narrative or phenomenological layer** (inadmissible without new assumptions).

At this point, the term acts as a "Trojan Horse," smuggling inadmissible meaning past the boundary controls.

---

## Procedure: Semantic Layer Separation

When a fracture is encountered:

### Step 1 — Allow Full Usage Up to Fracture
The term must be allowed to function normally until the derivation itself exposes inconsistency. No preemptive restriction is permitted.

### Step 2 — Identify Competing Layers
Explicitly map the distinct meanings being conflated.
*   *Example:* "Authority" = Coordination Role (Structural) + Moral Righteousness (Narrative).

### Step 3 — Perform Layer Separation
Separate the term into its component definitions. Treat them as distinct variables.

### Step 4 — Isolate the Structural Component
Identify which layer remains valid under the core constraints (C1–C7).
This component is usually relational, negative, or operational.

### Step 5 — Suspend the Narrative/Subjective Layers
Explicitly mark the non-structural layers as **Out of Scope**.
*   *Note:* This does not declare them false. It declares them inadmissible for this specific derivation.

### Step 6 — Explicitly Declare Scope Restriction
Record that only the **structural component** remains in scope for this derivation going forward.

### Step 7 — Continue or Terminate
- If a structural component exists, continue reasoning using that component only.
- If the term dissolves entirely into narrative/subjective layers, the derivation terminates.

Termination is a correct outcome.
