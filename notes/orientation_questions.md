You do not need to consider all of them.

You may think about them on your own, or explore them by conversing with a freshly initialized language model.

No answers are provided here.

You are free to explore these questions with any conversational partner, including language models that have not been initialized with this framework. Comparing how different reasoning systems respond may itself be informative.
