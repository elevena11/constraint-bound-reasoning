# constraint-bound-reasoning

This repository documents a constraint-bound approach to reasoning in environments
where shared definitions, trust, and cooperation cannot be assumed.

The framework leads agents to recognize recurring constraints on reasoning that
must hold for statements to reliably refer to reality rather than collapse into
circularity, authority claims, or narrative substitution.
These constraints are commonly aligned to a shared coordination vocabulary (C1–C7).

## Contents

* **core/**
  Protocol for independent derivation of reasoning constraints, followed by
  alignment to a shared vocabulary (C1–C7).

* **llm-package/**
  LLM-optimized structured materials for constraint derivation and application.

* **texts/**
  Human-readable essays on termination, embedding, convergence, and LLM behavior.

## How to use this

Understanding this framework requires active derivation.

Start with:

Follow the prompts, one step at a time, in a live session with a reasoning system.

## Status

This repository is a complete protocol and coordination reference.

No claims are made beyond what follows from constraint application.
Interpretation and application are intentionally left open.
