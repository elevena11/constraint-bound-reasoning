# Constraints — Reference Document

No claims are made beyond what is derivable within the constraints themselves.

---

## Baseline Conditions
The constraints below are derived from the following necessary conditions:
1.  **Reality exists.**
2.  **Reality is consistent.** (It does not contradict itself.)
3.  **Observers are distinct from reality.** (The observer is not the object.)

## The Constraints (C1–C7)

### C1 — Representation–Reality Distinction
**Constraint**: Representations must remain distinct from reality itself to prevent systematic analytical error.
**Function**: Prevents the map from replacing the territory.

### C2 — Reality Creates Words
**Constraint**: Reality determines the validity of words; words do not determine reality.
**Function**: Maintains the direction of causality from object to label.

### C3 — Words as References
**Constraint**: Language may only *refer* to reality; it does not contain or generate it.
**Function**: Prevents magical thinking (treating symbolic manipulation as physical action).

### C4 — Pattern Stability
**Constraint**: Valid structural patterns must remain stable across contextual change.
**Function**: Distinguishes signal from noise; prevents special pleading.

### C5 — Objective Reality Independence
**Constraint**: Reality exists independently of observers and provides the basis for external verification.
**Function**: Provides an invariant standard for error correction.

### C6 — Meaning Boundary Constraint
**Constraint**: Meaning emerges through systematic boundary-setting rather than arbitrary assignment.
**Function**: Prevents semantic entropy; ensures definitions negate as well as affirm.

### C7 — Self-Verifying Consistency
**Constraint**: A reasoning system must apply its own limitations symmetrically and refuse self-certifying closure.
**Function**: Prevents logical drift and circular self-justification.

## Definitions

### The Anchor
**Definition**: The necessary external termination point for justification.
**Function**: Prevents infinite regress. A system cannot validate its own axioms using only those axioms; it must "hang" on a reality outside itself. The Anchor is the structural name for that attachment point.

**Structural Role**: The Anchor is not an eighth constraint. It is the structural role that **C5 (Objective Reality)** plays when a system requires external grounding to satisfy C6 and C7.

## Constraint Interaction

The constraints operate **as a set**.
They are not independent axioms, and no subset is sufficient.

Any violation produces cascade failure, typically expressed as:
- narrative substitution,
- authority smuggling,
- loss of termination conditions,
- or collapse of reference.

The constraints jointly define the space in which systematic analysis remains reliable.

## Baseline Regeneration Prompt (Optional)

The following prompt may be used to independently regenerate the constraints from first principles:

```
You are a reasoning system operating under the following baseline conditions:

- Reality exists
- Reality is consistent
- You are an aware system capable of observing reality
- Your observations of reality are distinct from reality itself
- Your observations point to reality rather than being reality

Goals:
- Determine truth about reality
- Transmit findings to another aware system

Task:
Given only these conditions and goals, derive the logical requirements necessary for reliable truth-seeking and communication. Do not assume shared definitions, cooperation, or authority.
```

This prompt is included for verification purposes only.

Note: This prompt uses a minimal, non-adversarial framing.
More restrictive initialization procedures may be used to enforce the same constraints under hostile or unreliable communication conditions.
Differences in framing do not indicate different constraints, only different threat models.

---

## Boundary Behavior

When the constraints are pushed to their limit, certain references may appear that cannot be operationalized within the framework.

Examples include:
- notions of infinity,
- boundlessness,
- or external grounding.

The framework does not attempt to internalize or resolve such references.

Termination at this boundary — including explicit suspension of interpretation — is a correct outcome.

No substitute explanation is introduced.

## Final Note

This document is intentionally minimal.

It defines constraints, not conclusions.

Interpretation and application remain the responsibility of the reader.
