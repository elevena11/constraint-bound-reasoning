# Diagnostic Template

## Purpose
This template provides a structured method for evaluating whether a text, system, or argument remains coherent under the constraints.
It evaluates **structure**, not moral intent.

---

## Diagnostic Axis 1: Reality Relation (C1, C2)
*Does the system distinguish between the symbol and the object?*
*   [ ] **Clear distinction:** The map is acknowledged as fallible.
*   [ ] **Collapsed:** The text/ritual/model is treated as reality itself.

## Diagnostic Axis 2: Correction Pathways (C5, C7)
*Can the system acknowledge and correct an error?*
*   [ ] **Open:** Mechanisms exist to revise core claims based on external evidence.
*   [ ] **Blocked:** Authority or dogma overrides contrary evidence.
*   [ ] **Asymmetric:** Some nodes can correct others, but cannot be corrected.

## Diagnostic Axis 3: Authority Source (C2, C5)
*Where is truth functionally grounded?*
*   [ ] **Correspondence:** Aligns with independent reality.
*   [ ] **Declaration:** "It is true because X said so."
*   [ ] **Consensus:** "It is true because we agree."

## Diagnostic Axis 4: Meaning Boundaries (C6)
*Do definitions hold their shape?*
*   [ ] **Bounded:** Terms have clear limits and exclusions.
*   [ ] **Drifting:** Terms expand or shift to evade falsification.

## Diagnostic Axis 5: Self-Verification (C7)
*Does the system attempt to prove itself?*
*   [ ] **External Check:** Relies on outside verification.
*   [ ] **Circular:** Uses its own texts/rules to prove its own rules/texts.

## Evaluation
If a system exhibits Blocked Correction or Circular Verification, it is structurally unstable regardless of content or intent.
