# Structural Failure Modes

When constraints are relaxed, specific analytical failures reappear. These are structural consequences.

## 1. Representation Collapse (Violates C1)
The system treats the symbol as the object.
*   *Symptom:* "Magical thinking"—belief that changing the word changes the world.
*   *Result:* Loss of error detection.

## 2. Authority Substitution (Violates C2, C5)
Truth is defined by the source rather than the object.
*   *Symptom:* "Who said it?" replaces "Is it true?"
*   *Result:* Correction becomes impossible without permission.

## 3. Nominalist Drift (Violates C4, C6)
Definitions change opportunistically to preserve a conclusion.
*   *Symptom:* Moving the goalposts; "No True Scotsman" fallacies.
*   *Result:* Communication breaks down; patterns become unrecognizable.

## 4. The Self-Sealing Loop (Violates C7)
The system explains away all counter-evidence using internal logic.
*   *Symptom:* Conspiracy theories; unfalsifiable ideologies.
*   *Result:* The system becomes a closed hallucination, detached from reality.

## 5. Epistemic Coercion (Violates C5, C7))
Trust is demanded as a precondition for engagement.
*   *Symptom:* Skepticism is framed as a moral failing or hostility.
*   *Result:* Analysis is replaced by compliance.
