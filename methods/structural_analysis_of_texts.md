# Structural Analysis of Historical Texts

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **methodological boundaries** for applying constraint-bound reasoning to historical or culturally significant texts.

Its sole purpose is to provide a **stable internal reference** so that:
- the method remains consistent across sessions,
- exploration does not drift into belief, identity, or authority claims,
- and results remain interpretable as structural observations only.

This is not a theory of history, theology, philosophy, or meaning.

## Unit of Analysis

The unit of analysis is **language under constraint**, not doctrine or intent.

Specifically, analysis focuses on:
- individual phrases,
- clusters of statements,
- or recurring patterns

that remain interpretable after enforcing C1–C7.

## What Counts as Structural Compliance

A statement or pattern is considered *structurally compliant* if it:

1. Does not collapse representation into reality (C1–C3)
2. Does not rely on observer privilege (C5)
3. Remains interpretable across contextual change (C4)
4. Respects meaning boundaries and terminates cleanly (C6)
5. Avoids self-certifying claims or implicit authority (C7)

Compliance does not mean the statement is "true".
It means it does not rely on inadmissible moves.

## Boundary Behavior (Critical)

When analysis approaches explanatory limits:

- No closure is forced
- No identity is inferred
- No narrative is introduced
- No authority is asserted

Acceptable outcomes at the boundary include:
- minimal relational descriptions,
- explicit suspension of interpretation,
- or silence.

"I do not know" is a correct terminal state.
